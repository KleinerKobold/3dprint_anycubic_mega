## How to Calibrate the Printer

# Extruder Steps
To calibrate your extruder, you have to extrude filament with the hotend. 
Therefore you have to measure the filament before the extruder and extrude a specific amount of material. The printer should be heated so you don't damage your printer.
After that you measure again what is left of the filament. The difference can be used to calibrate the esteps of the extruder
